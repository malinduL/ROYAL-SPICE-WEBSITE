      </p>

      <p>
      <h4>What Are Cookies?</h4><br>
      Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h4><br>

      <p>  
      <h4>Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information</h4><br>

      <h4>Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site</h4><br>
      We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site. 
      Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
